# my_pkg
This package is used for orcahrd naviagation simulatins. It contains  python scripts, and maps directory.
The worlds/launch directories is NOT a part of my_pkg. Its content should be coppied to the worlds/launch directories in the navigation stack.
One has to first install the jackal_navigation stack and then add my_pkg package using Catkin_make
What appears on Github  is only :
1. my_pkg directory (with the scripts and maps)
2.package.xml & Cmakelists.txt that should be added to my_pkg folder
3.worlds & launch files directories (their content should be copied to the same folders inside the navigation stack)
4.Presentation folder
5.sh_files folder- for bash scripts. These should be copied to the userâ€™s home directory.
